# TextGridControl
Implementation of a Textbox control having a DataGridView for a dropdown. This also supports basic DataGridView DataSource binding and Filtering.

I was looking for a control that is a texbox by default but has the capability of a dropdown datagridview.
The samples online are too overkill so I created my own simple UserControl.

This control can be added to any forms as a textbox. It's very basic and can still be enhanced based on your own requirement.
